        Manual restock?
        In store checkout?
            

What we need to discuss
    Whether we have manual restock or not?
    How do we want to implement in store purchases?
    What does UPC(barcode) mean?
    What does frequent under customer mean?
    How is credit done?
    Exactly what information is stored for each customer?
    Should searches be done on the server? Probably
    What goes in order history
    Can customers have multiple credit cards attached to their account?
