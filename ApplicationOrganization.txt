What we need to discuss
    Whether we have manual restock or not?
        Yes
    How do we want to implement in store purchases?
        Add a field for whether it is in store or not
    What does UPC(barcode) mean?
        NA
    What does frequent under customer mean?
        They just have an online accout
    How is credit done?
        Default
    Exactly what information is stored for each customer?
        addresses, credit card, name, id
            -> Add a name field
        Online accounts
            email
    Should searches be done on the server? Probably
        Searches will be done on server
        Just limit by store, then category, then brand, or whatever
    What goes in order history
        What expected
    Can customers have multiple credit cards attached to their account?
        yes

 ~ Kaylee's Notes for placeOrder
 -- if they don't have account, will have to use the "add credit card" / "add address", also used in the "make online account" (see above note)
 -- MUST pass in PIDs, Quantities as lists (it was the best way to check totals and quantities in placeOrder.py) 
 -- possible error messages when trying to place an order: 
        1) tried to order more quantity than was available, 
        2) didn't have enough credit, 
        3) the database crapped out on me again
 -- regardless if they have an account or not, should return the tracking info and shipping company name, if successfully placed
